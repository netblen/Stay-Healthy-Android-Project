## An andriod application written in java for the backend, using xml for the frontend, our fitness app lets users track more then just thier workouts, while also combining comunity.

this was made as a final group project for a andriod class, to show and test our skills and what we have learnt during this semester.

### The app features:

* A colorful home page where users can see thier past workout information like time, steps, calories burnt and total time of activity this week.
* We have diffrent work out catogories: running, walking, swimming, and circut workout.
* Users can track their sleep and see past data.
* To make out app community focused there is a community tap to allow users to make and join group for the different type of work out categories to help find people with similar interests.
